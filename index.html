		<h3>How to play the game.</h3>
		<p>So, this indeed is a basic typing game. You gotta show your best typing skills to survive in this game.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The aim is simple... Type a spell from the list of spells and press <b>enter</b> to execute a spell.</li>
			<li>The faster you type and execute, the quicker the health of the opponent decreases.</li>
			<li>The opponent (the dark species indeed...!!!) would continually attack you... You won't be spared if you can't keep up with them.!!!</li>
			<li>So... the one who dies first, loses... so simple!</li>
			<li>You can see your characters per min and words per min from the side pane... making it a real typing test too :-p</li>
		</ul>
